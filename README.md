This work was built based on YOLO11 (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
This work proposed a dense component detection network (DCD-Net) based on some improvements upon YOLO11-nano. 
The PCBA dataset this work used were modified based on "Data-Efficient Graph Embedding Learning for PCB Component Detection" (DOI: 10.1109/WACV.2019.00064).
